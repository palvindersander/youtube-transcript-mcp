## Current Project Status

The YouTube Transcript MCP Server is fully functional with the following capabilities:

- Fetch transcripts from any YouTube video that has captions
- Display transcripts with ~10 second merged segments for improved readability
- Retrieve and include comprehensive video metadata (title, author, description)
- Extract video statistics (view count, likes, upload date)
- Identify and display chapter markers within videos
- Support multiple languages when available
- MCP integration with Claude Desktop

All core functionality is implemented and working, with comprehensive documentation in place.
